XTB-autoTrader

Trading bot for XTB XStation. Includes logging, Gmail reporting (every ~30min), economic calendar analysis, support and resistance levels analysis, trends analysis, SlowStoch indicator, money management, trailing stoploss for opened trades, emergency trade close.

Bot can be used with any XStation account. Bot requires UserID and password each time it's started.

Bot has been tested on demo account and was running whole month on AWS Ubuntu server.

The strategy used in this bot is not a winning strategy. This is a pre-update version which I decided to publish.
